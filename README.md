# burger
The burger application allows users to input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user adds a burger name, the app will display the burger in the “eat the burger” section of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the devoured section of the page. The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not!
